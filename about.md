Hi, I'm Raymond Cheong Cano, a Computer Science major at Rice University. I'm 
awed by the capabilities of machine learning and the elegance of efficient 
algorithms. I prefer back end work to front end, but I have experience with 
both. 

As for my hobbies, love basketball, soccer and Music. In particular I'm a huge rockets fan and 
a huge Hip Hop fan. I would really like to take on a data science project 
with my favorite rappers. I'll figure that one out soon. 

My contact info is below. Feel free to hit me up ^.^
