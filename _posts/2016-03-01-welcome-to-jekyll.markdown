Hey guys, this is my first blog post ^.^

I've put off making a blog and website for awhile now, mainly because I used the excuse of time. However, this spring break I had the time, so I figured I'd dedicate two hours each day towards making a dope ass website. I feel that most tech people have dank websites, and it always sucked not having having a url to cp when filling out applications to this or that. 

I heard some while ago that XX% of a project is getting started (it might be 90, but I really don't know). That's why I'm saying I'm mostly done, even though this thing is template af rn and I have yet to really add anything. There was a huge block because I just didn't know where to start, but after making my [sister's christmas present][leesa_xmas] I installed everything for jekyll (but didn't use it) which is kind of a pain for windows and figured out how github pages worked, I finally did it (whoo!). 

In general I always feel like getting started on a project has such a huge block. I could go play basketball, I could do my homework, I could make sad love songs about my ex -- all these things just are so much easier than starting a project and having to learn new tools. I think the thing that's most frustrating is that you wanna do so much but you need to have such a level of esoteric knowledge of the tool you're using that often times you can't get exactly what you want in a short time. 

So just the fact that this started after spending ~1 year on my to do list has me really excited. 

Other plans for spring break: Interview practice, work on [this project][political-bias], do my homework...even now it feels like I won't be doing anything but the homework part. But we'll see. Hopefully it all turns out nicely ^.^
